# Emotion Recognition in Artworks: Leveraging CNNs for Visual Emotion Analysis and Chatbot Development
The project develops a comprehensive system that combines emotion recognition in artworks with interactive AI-driven conversations. Using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), we classify the emotions evoked by images into distinct categories. This model is then integrated with a fine-tuned Llama 2-Chat language model to create an intelligent chatbot. The chatbot is designed to analyze images emotionally and engage with users through meaningful evokes emotional interactions, connecting the gap between visual art analysis and conversational AI.
